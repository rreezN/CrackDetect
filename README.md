</p>

# Quickstart
1. Clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/rreezN/CrackDetect.git```.
2. (Optional) Create [Virtual environment in powershell](#virtual-environment-in-powershell). Note this project requires ```python >= 3.10```.
3. Install requirements ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. 
4. Download the data from [sciencedata.dk](https://sciencedata.dk/themes/deic_theme_oc7/apps/files_sharing/public.php?g=dtu.dk&t=df00c89039ec32807b9c8d794bc8e2f5&), unzip it and place it in the data folder (see [data section](#downloading-the-data)).
5. Call ```wandb disabled``` if you have not set-up a suitable wandb project. (This project and entity information has been hard-coded into ```src\train_hydra_mr.py``` as the ```wandb.init()``` command.)
6. Run ```python src/main.py all```

This will run all steps of the pipeline, from data preprocessing to model prediction. At the end a plot will appear that shows our (FleetYeeters) results and the results from the newly trained model. It will extract features using a Hydra model from all signals except location signals. The *main.py* script is setup to recreate our results, and thus all arguments are pre specified. 

It is possible to call *main.py* with individual steps, or beginning at a certain step. To call individual steps, you would replace all with the desired step. Possible steps are:
```shell
python src/main.py [all, make_data, extract_features, train_model, predict_model, validate_model]
```

Additionally, if you wish to start from a specific step, skipping the steps before, you can add the `--begin-from` argument, i.e. if you wish to start from predict_model you would call:
```shell
python src/main.py --begin-from predict_model
```

If you wish to go through each step manually with your own arguments, call each script directly with its own arguments:

1. Create dataset with ```python src/data/make_dataset.py all```
2. Extract features with ```python src/data/feature_extraction```
3. Train model with ```python src/train_hydra_mr.py```
4. Predict using trained model with ```python src/predict_model.py```
5. See results in ```reports/figures/model_results```

2. Install requirements

> **Note**: This project requires python > 3.10 to run

There are two options for installing requirements. If you wish to setup a dedicated python virtual environment for the project, follow the steps in [Virtual environment in powershell](#virtual-environment-in-powershell). If not, then simply run the following command, and all python modules required to run the project will be installed
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Virtual environment in powershell
Have `python >= 3.10`
1. CD to CrackDetect `cd CracDetect`
2. `python -m venv fleetenv` -- Create environment
3. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` -- Change execution policy if necessary (to be executed in powershell)
4. `.\fleetenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` -- Activate venv
5. `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel`
6. `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. ...
8. Profit

To activate venv in powershell:
```shell
.\fleetenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```


# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

There are several steps in the pipeline of this project. Detailed explanations of each step, and how to use them in code can be found in notebooks in ```notebooks/```.

## Downloading the data
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The data is made available at [sciencedata.dk](https://sciencedata.dk/themes/deic_theme_oc7/apps/files_sharing/public.php?g=dtu.dk&t=df00c89039ec32807b9c8d794bc8e2f5&). 

Once downloaded it should be unzipped and placed in the empty ```data/``` folder. The file structure should be as follows:
- data
  - raw
    - AutoPi_CAN
      - platoon_CPH1_HH.hdf5
      - platoon_CPH1_VH.hdf5
      - read_hdf5_platoon.m

      - cph1_zp_vh.csv

## Preprocessing the data
[(Notebook)](notebooks/make_dataset.ipynb) [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The data goes through several preprocessing steps before it is ready for use in the feature extractor.

1. Convert
2. Validate
3. Segment
4. Matching
5. Resampling
6. KPIs

To run all preprocessing steps
```
python src/data/make_dataset.py all
```

A single step can be run by changing `all` to the desired step (e.g. `matching`). You can also run from a step to the end by calling, e.g. from (including) `validate`:

```
python src/data/make_dataset.py --begin_from validate 
```

The main data preprocessing script is found in [src/data/make_dataset.py](src/data/make_dataset.py). It has the following arguments and default parameters
- `mode all`
- `--begin-from` (False)
- `--skip-gopro` (False)
- `--speed-threshold 5`
- `--time-threshold 10`
- `--verbose` (False)

## Feature extraction
[(Notebook)](notebooks/feature_extraction.ipynb) [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

There are two feature extractors implemented in this repository: [HYDRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13652) and [MultiRocket](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00457). They are found in [src/models/hydra](src/models/hydra/) and [src/models/multirocket](src/models/multirocket/). 

The main feature extraction is found in [src/data/feature_extraction.py](src/data/feature_extraction.py). It has the following arguments and default parameters
- `--cols acc.xyz_0 acc.xyz_1 acc.xyz_2`
- `--all_cols` (default False)
- `--all_cols_wo_location` (default False)
- `--feature_extractor both` (choices: `multirocket`, `hydra`, `both`)
- `--mr_num_features 50000`
- `--hydra_k 8`
- `--hydra_g 64`
- `--subset None`
- `--name_identifier` (empty string)
- `--folds 5`
- `--seed 42`

To extract features using HYDRA and MultiRocket, call 
```shell
python src/data/feature_extraction.py
```

The script will automatically set up the feature extractors based on the amount of cols (1 = univariate, >1 = multivariate). The features will be stored in [data/processed/features.hdf5](data/processed/features.hdf5), along with statistics used to standardize during training and prediction. Features and statistics will be saved under feature extractors based on their names as defined in the model scripts.

The structure of the HDF5 features file can be seen below

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="reports/figures/features_tree.png" style="width:50%">
</div>

You can print the structure of your own features.hdf5 file with `src/data/check_hdf5.py` by calling

```shell
python src/data/check_hdf5.py
```

`check_hdf5` has the following arguments and defaults

- `--file_path data/processed/features.hdf5`
- `--limit 3`
- `--summary` (False)


## Model training
[(Notebook)](notebooks/train_model.ipynb) [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

A simple model has been implemented in [src/models/hydramr.py](src/models/hydramr.py). 
The model training script is implemented in [src/train_hydra_mr.py](src/train_hydra_mr.py). It has the following arguments and default parameters
- `--epochs 50`
- `--batch_size 32`
- `--lr 1e-3`
- `--feature_extractors HydraMV_8_64`
- `--name_identifier` (empty string)
- `--folds 5`
- `--model_name HydraMRRegressor`
- `--weight_decay 0.0`
- `--hidden_dim 64`
- `--project_name hydra_mr_test` (for wandb)
- `--dropout 0.5`
- `--model_depth 0`
- `--batch_norm` (False)

To train the model using Hydra on a multivariate dataset call
```shell
python src/train_hydra_mr.py
```

The trained model will be saved in [models/](models/), along with the best model during training (based on validation loss) for each fold. The training curves are saved in [reports/figures/model_results](reports/figures/model_results/).

Trained models will be saved based on the name in their model file scripts.

## Predicting
[(Notebook)](notebooks/predict_model.ipynb) [(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To predict using the trained model use the script [src/predict_model.py](src/predict_model.py). It has the following arguments and default parameters
- `--model models/HydraMRRegressor/HydraMRRegressor.pt`
- `--data data/processed/features.hdf5`
- `--name_identifier` (empty string)
- `--data_type test`
- `--batch_size 32`
- `--plot_during` (False)
- `--fold -1`
- `--save_predictions` (False)

To run the script on the saved HydraMRRegressor model, call
```shell
python src/predict_model.py
```

The model will predict on the specified data set, plot the predictions and save them in [reports/figures/model_results](reports/figures/model_results/).

### Points of Interest (POI) 
Finally the predictions is translated to the actual locations in the real world; the process can be seen in the top figure of the README. To investigate it one can run the Points of Interest Notebook ```notebooks/POI.ipynb```.
